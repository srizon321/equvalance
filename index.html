                <h3 class="tags_explanationh3" style="color: #f02b2b;">The principle you're referring to is known as the "Mass-Energy Equivalence Principle,</br> which is a fundamental concept in physics,</br> famously encapsulated by Einstein's equation 
                    𝐸
                    =
                    𝑚

                        <li style="color: #0fff07;">1. Mass and Energy Relationship</li></br>
                        The principle states that mass 
                        𝑚
                        m and energy 
                        𝐸
                        E are interchangeable and directly related. Energy can be converted into mass, and vice versa.

            <p style="color: #f02b2b;">The equation 
                𝐸
                =
                𝑚
                𝑐

            <h3 style="color: #0fff07;">Implications</h3></br>
            <li style="color: #f02b2b;">It implies that mass can be converted entirely into energy and vice versa.</br> This concept underpins nuclear reactions (like those in stars or nuclear power plants) where mass is converted into energy.</li>
            <li style="color: #f02b2b;">It also explains why large amounts of energy are released in nuclear reactions or particle-antiparticle annihilation processes,</br> where mass is converted into energy according to 
                𝐸
                =
                𝑚
                𝑐

        <div class="explanaition4">
            <h3 style="color: #0fff07;">Experimental Verification</h3><p></p></br>
            <li style="color: #f02b2b;"> The principle has been extensively verified through experiments,</br> including nuclear reactions, particle physics experiments, and practical applications like nuclear energy.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="explanaition5">
            <h3 style="color: #0fff07;">Conceptual Understanding</h3><p></p></br>
            <li style="color: #f02b2b;"> It revolutionized our understanding of the nature of mass and energy,</br> showing that they are not separate entities but different forms of the same underlying substance, which is sometimes referred to as "matter-energy."</li>
